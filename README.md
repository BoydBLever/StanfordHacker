## Description

### What is the StanfordHacker project?

The StanfordHacker project was born from my desire to provide a seamless experience for travelers heading to Silicon Valley to rent a bed at my residence - which is known as Stanford Hacker House since it is located across the street from Stanford University and is marketed towards other software engineers and hackers - for about $1000 on a month-to-month basis. Though I have an existing WordPress site for Stanford Hacker House at [stanfordhacker.com](http://stanfordhacker.com), my WordPress proficiency is not high enough to handle the integration of advanced functionalities, such as the payment portal I envisioned and that I knew guests wanted to use.

Recognizing these challenges, I decided to leverage my advanced Java programming prowess. The result? A full-stack Spring Boot application offering a rich user experience. Some highlights include an interactive carousel showcasing the amenities available and a sophisticated payment gateway allowing guests to effortlessly reserve their spots.
